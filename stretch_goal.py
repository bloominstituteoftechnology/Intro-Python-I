'''
Write a program to determine if a number, given on the command line, is prime.
(In math, prime numbers are whole numbers greater than 1, 
 that have only two factors â€“ 1 and the number itself.
 Prime numbers are divisible only by the number 1 or itself.)

- How can you optimize this program?

- Implement The Sieve of Eratosthenes,
  one of the oldest algorithms known (ca. 200 BC).
