"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

foo = open('./src/foo.txt', 'r')
print(foo.read())
foo.close()

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

bar = open('./src/bar.txt', 'w')
bar.write('This is the first line\nThis is the second line\nThis is the third line')
bar.close()
