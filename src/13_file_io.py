"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

f = open("foo.txt", "r")
list(map(print, f))
f.close() 

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

f = open("bar.txt", "w")
f.write("Test 1\n")
f.write("Test B\n")
f.write("Test Î³\n")
f.close()
