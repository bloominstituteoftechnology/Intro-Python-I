"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

with open('foo.txt', 'r') as f:
    print(f.readlines())


# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

ac = ['what', 'is', 'arbitrary']
with open('bar.txt', 'w') as f:
    for line in ac:
        f.write(line + '\n')
