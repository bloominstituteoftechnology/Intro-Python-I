"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE

with open('foo.txt') as f:
    print(f.read())

    print(f.closed)

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open('bar.txt', 'w') as f2:
    f2.writelines(["Yankho; \n", ";Wrote \n", "This"])

with open('bar.txt') as f3:
    print(f3.read())

print(f2.closed)
print(f3.closed)
