Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
f = open('foo.txt')
a = f.read()
# f = open('foo.txt', 'w')
f.close()

with open('foo.txt') as f:
    f.read()
    f.close()
# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
f = open('bar.txt', 'w')
f.write("This is my first file created. It's called bar.txt. I'll open and see")
