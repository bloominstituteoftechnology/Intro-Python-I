# Experiment with scopes in Python.

# When you use a variable in a function, it's local in scope to the function.
x = 12

def change_x():
    global x
    x = 99

change_x()

# This prints 12. What do we have to modify in change_x() to get it to print 99?
print(x)
# we need to use the global keyword so that python knows that we want to reference the global x


# This nested function has a similar problem.

def outer():
    y = 120

    def inner():
        nonlocal y
        y = 999

    inner()

    # This prints 120. What do we have to change in inner() to get it to print
    # 999?
    # Note: Google "python nested function scope".
    # in python there doesn't appear to be closures so we must use the nonlocal keyword to reference variables from the parent function
    print(y)


outer()
