"""
Dictionaries are Python's implementation of associative arrays.
There's not much different with Python's version compared to what
you'll find in other languages (though you can also initialize and
populate dictionaries using comprehensions just like you can with
lists!).

The docs can be found here:
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries

For this exercise, you have a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
has the following keys:
 - lat: a signed integer representing a latitude value
 - lon: a signed integer representing a longitude value
 - name: a name string for this location
