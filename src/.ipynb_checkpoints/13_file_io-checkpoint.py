# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain
