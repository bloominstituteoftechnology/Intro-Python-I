I have created a class to contain each of the objectives and demonstrate their outputs in action.
Each test will be labelled and in the case of what requires many print statements will be indented. This should prove intuitive.

1: Simply run etisdew.py
2: No step two, thats it. You should review the call to function(s) in the init, and the definitions within if that was easy enough though.
