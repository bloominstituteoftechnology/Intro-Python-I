# Print out 2 to the 65536 power
# (try doing the same thing in the JS console and see what it outputs)

# YOUR CODE HERE

print(2**65536)


# 1. Integers
myint = 9
print(myint)

#2. Floating point numbers
myfloat = 7.245
print(myfloat)
myfloat2 = float(7)
print(myfloat2)

# 3. Strings can use " or '
mystring = 'hello'
print(mystring)

# 4. Apostrophes
mystring2 = "don't worry about apostrophes"

# #5 Simple operations
# one = 1
# two = 2
# three = one + two
# print(three)

hello = "hello"
world = "world"
helloworld = hello +" "+ world
print(helloworld)

# 6. Simultaneous assignment
a, b = 3, 4
print(a, b)
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)

# 8. Mixing operators with strings and numbers
# This wil not work...

one = 1
two = 2
hello = "hello"

# print(one + two + hello)
print(str(one) + str(two) + hello)
