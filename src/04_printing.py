"""
Python provides a number of ways to perform printing. Research
how to print using the printf operator, the `format` string 
method, and by using f-strings.

x = 10
y = 2.24552
z = "I like turtles!"

# Using the printf operator (%), print the following feeding in the values of x,
# y, and z:
# x is 10, y is 2.25, z is "I like turtles!"
print("x is %d, y is %.2f, z is %s" % (10, 2.25, '"I like turtles!"'))


# Use the 'format' string method to print the same thing
print("x is {0}, y is {1}, z is {2}".format(10, 2.25, '"I like turtles!"'))


# Finally, print the same thing using an f-string
x = 10
y = 2.25
z = '"I like turtles!"'
print(f"x is {x}, y is {y}, z is {z}")
