# For the exercise, look up the methods and functions that are available for use
# with Python lists.

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [8, 9, 10]

# For the following, DO NOT USE AN ASSIGNMENT (=).

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4]
# YOUR CODE HERE
print(x)

# Using y, change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]
# YOUR CODE HERE
print(x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10]
# YOUR CODE HERE
print(x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 99, 10]
# YOUR CODE HERE
print(x)

# Print the length of list x
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Print all the values in x multiplied by 1000
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Method to declare a list 
# Suppose name of list is "l_list"
# So we will declare it as follow:
# l_list = list(input().split())


# If you want to print that list you can make of use args
# print(*l_list)
# here * allows you to print that list in a single line
