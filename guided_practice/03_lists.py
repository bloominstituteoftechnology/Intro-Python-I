Lists
"""

# Lists are very similar to arrays.

# They can contain any type of variable, and they
# can contain as many variables as you wish.

# Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.

# # 1.
# mylist = []
# mylist.append(1)
# mylist.append(2)
# mylist.append(3)
# print(mylist[0])  # prints 1
# print(mylist[1])  # prints 2
# print(mylist[2])  # prints 3

# # prints out 1,2,3
# for x in mylist:
#     print(x)

# # 2. If index doesn't exist, an exception is raised
# mylist = [1,2,3]
# print(mylist[10])
